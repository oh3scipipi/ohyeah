## 1. Low-Hanging Fruits (Quick Wins)

### Linux & Windows

- Default/weak credentials (e.g., admin:admin, guest:guest)
- Anonymous or default shares (SMB/NFS/FTP)
- Unpatched known vulnerabilities (searchsploit, CVE checks)
- Publicly accessible sensitive files (robots.txt, .git, backups)
- Misconfigured services (world-writable files, weak permissions)
- Cleartext passwords in scripts/configs
- Password reuse across services/users
- Open directories/web root exposures
- Outdated web applications/plugins
