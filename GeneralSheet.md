Believe in yourself you can do it!

Check nmap from wider to narrow.

  Take a note ports and software versions.
    Are you already recognised some of them take note! Don't attack
  IS THERE A WEIRD PORT! Take a note!

Probably there are low hanging fruits!
  DON'T BE RUSH

NOW DO YOU BELIEVE YOU TOOK EVERYTHING NOTES!
  ARE THERE STILL SO MUCH DETAIL - MAKE IT SHORTER

AND IF YOU ARE READY LET's THINK ABOUT IT

LET's DECIDE ABOUT OS
  IS IT OBVIOUS WINDOWs or LINUX
    Which version Win which kernel and dist linux? 

TAKE A NOTE!!!
ALSO WRITE TO PAPER! I AM OLD SCHOOL AND I DON't TRUST THE MACHINES!
    
WHICH PORTS ARE OPEN
  22? or ANY SSH -> it means you will check /etc/ssh/ssh_config and see where are the keys and types of them 
                                            ~/.ssh/config
                                            /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa  -  .pub
                                            /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa  -  .pub
                                            /home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa  -  .pub
                                            /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519  -  .pub
                            AND ETC...
                            BUT DON't FORGET THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR STEALING BUT ALSO GIVING YOUR SELF AUTHORIZATION
